			<h2>Managing Content</h2>
			<p>To manage the content of your site first login to the administration area. To login go to 40westarts.com/admin. Once logged in you'll need to open the <a href="https://docs.kentico.com/display/K9/Working+with+pages">Pages application.</a></p>
			<img src="https://docs.kentico.com/download/attachments/59637900/pages_application.png?version=1&modificationDate=1402475997921&api=v2" width="100%" alt="">
			<p>Select the page you want to edit in the content tree. Make sure Page tab is selected, and you'll see your editable areas outlined. Make your changes and then press the save button.</p>
			<img src="images/2.png" width="50%" alt="">

			<h3>Edit regions & web parts button</h3>
			<p>There is an interface that will make editing editable regions faster and cleaner. First go to the General tab. Scroll to the bottom and click the "Edit regions & web parts" button. This will bring up a window with every editable region listed out on the left, and a full WYSIWYG editor. This is the recommended way to edit content, as the Pages page can often be buggy from trying to inherit the site's styles.</p>

			<img src="images/33.png" width="50%" alt="" style="float: right;">

			<h3>Adding donation links</h3>
			<p>Create a new link that links to: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr%20%20?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=26DWTTW4LHV6Q</p>
			<h3>Adding Constant Contact sign up links</h3>
			<p>Create a new link that links to: https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=lmek5jhab&p=oi&m=1107361599883&sit=w8pfamigb&f=8e66233f-e546-4f91-8fa4-e5c5ced7fdf0</p>
		</div>

		<div id="wysiwyg" class="content-block">
			<h2>WYSIWYG</h2>
			<p>The WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor allows you to add small style tweeks to the content. You can do things like change font size and color, add images or videos, add widgets, write html, and <a href="http://www.kentico.com/product/all-features/web-content-management/wysiwyg-editor">much more.</a></p>
			<img src="images/3.png" width="50%" alt="">
		</div>

		<div id="page-types" class="content-block">
			<h2>Page Types</h2>
			<h3>Adding Page Types</h3>
			<p>Dynamic items on the site are managed as <a href="https://docs.kentico.com/display/K81/Page+types">Page Types.</a> Page types make it easy for content admins to add a new item to a list. Adding a new page type is done using the content tree. For example if you want to add a new Opportunity to the About page you should open the About page in the content tree, find the Opportunities folder, click on it and then click the + button. You'll be prompted to select the page type you want to create. Select the page type you're creating and then fill out the form.</p>
			<img src="images/4.png" width="50%" alt="">

			<h3>Page Type Actions</h3>
			<p>There's a list of actions you can do to a page type once created. Delete, Copy, Move - and you can do it across all sites. This means, you can create a new page, and then Copy it to another site.</p>
			<p>To do this first right click the page type to show the list of options. Next, click Copy. A window will pop up asking you to select the location to copy the page type to. You can change between sites using the drop down in the upper left corner. Select where in the tree you want to copy this page type to and then click the copy button.</p>

		<div id="creating-pages" class="content-block">
			<h2>Creating A New Page</h2>
			<p>Adding a new page is done using the content tree. First select the location you want the new page to live. This is an important step to keeping your site structured and clean. For example if you're creating a new page that will be linked to from the About page, you should create that page under the About page. You can do this by selecting the about page, pressing the + button, and selecting to create a new Page. Enter a name for your page, and select a template. You should select one of the template pages by searching for "template". Once you've created your new page you should go to the Pages tab and start entering content for your page. Your new page will by default be included in the site's navigation, and the url will be relative to the location of the new page in the tree. In our example the page was under the About page, so the url would be 40westarts.org/About/MyNewPage.</p>
			<img src="images/5.png" width="50%" alt="">
			<p>To remove your new page from the site's navigation you will need to go to the Navigation settings under the properties tab and uncheck "Show in navigation".</p>
			<img src="images/6.png" width="25%" alt="" style="float: left">
			<img src="images/7.png" width="25%" alt="">
			<p style="clear: both;">After creating a page you always want to change the template settings to use the nearest master page. This tells the page to use the template you selected and not it's parent's template. To do that click on the Template tab.</p>
			<img src="images/24.png" width="50%" alt="">
			<p>Then find and select the "Only the nearest master page" option. Then save.</p>
			<img src="images/25.png" width="50%" alt="">
		</div>

		<div id="uploading-files" class="content-block">
			<h2>Uploading Files</h2>
			<p>Files are just another Page Type. You add new files the same way you would a new page. At the bottom of the content tree there is a folder called File. Click on File and then click the plus to create a new Page Type. In the list of page types you can create, find and select File.</p>
			<img src="images/28.png" width="30%" alt="">
			<p>Upload your file using the form. Then press Save.</p>
			<img src="images/29.png" width="30%" alt="">
			<p>You'll see your newly created File Page Type under the Files folder in the tree. Select it, open the side menu, and press the Live Site button. This will open up your file in a new tab, showing you the url.</p>
			<img src="images/30.png" width="30%" alt="">
		</div>

		<div id="adding-destinations" class="content-block">
			<h2>Adding Destinations</h2>
			<p>Destinations can only be created by the user: 40WestArts. Log in as 40WestArts using the site's login form at <a href="http://40westarts.org/log-in">40westarts.org/log-in</a>. Navigate to the profile page. <a href="http://40westarts.org/business/40WestArts">40westarts.org/business/40WestArts</a>. You'll see a new button to add a destination.</p>
			<img src="images/23.png" width="50%" alt="">

		</div>

		<div id="creating-forms" class="content-block">
			<h2>Creating Forms</h2>
			<p>Creating a new form is done in the <a href="https://docs.kentico.com/display/K8/Forms">Forms application.</a></p>
			<img src="images/14.png" width="25%" alt="">
			<img src="images/15.png" width="50%" alt="">
			<p>To create a new form press the new form button. Enter a name for your form and press Save.</p>
			<img src="images/16.png" width="50%" alt="">
			<p>You'll be taken to the Form Builder. This is where you can build out your form by dragging components into the middle region. Play around with all the components and learn what they are. For regular input fields you should use the Text Box component. For a larger text area use the Text Area component. Once you've added a component to the form you'll see configuration options on the right. This is where you can change the input label, default value, set if it's required, and other settings. You can also add validation rules like a max character limit.</p>
			<img src="images/18.png" width="50%" alt="">
			<p>It's important to notice the side menu that will take you to other important configuration options for your new form. On the General page you can set options like where the page should redirect to after submitting, or the button text. The Email Notification page allows you to send an email to a specific email address every time someone submits the form. The Recorded Data page allows you to see the submission data for your form.</p>
			<img src="images/17.png" width="50%" alt="">
		</div>

		<div id="using-forms" class="content-block">
			<h2>Using Forms</h2>
			<p>You've created a new form; now it's time to add it to a page. Navigate to the Pages application and find the page you wish to add the form to. Click in the editable region and find the exact spot you want to add the form. Find the Insert/Edit Widget button on the WYSIWYG editor. It's the button with a gear in the middle.</p>

			<img src="images/19.png" width="50%" alt="">

			<p>A window will open asking you to select a widget. Search for "form" and select the On-line Form widget. Another window will pop up asking you the name of the form you'd like to use. Press the select button and find and select your new form. Press the Save &amp; Close button, and then finish up by saving the Page.</p>
